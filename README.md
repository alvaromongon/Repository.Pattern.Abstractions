# Introduction 
Basic repository pattern abstractions for Db with partition key and row key concepts

# Getting Started
Create your own implementation of the repository pattern, as an example I have my own implementation here:
https://github.com/alvaromongon/Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Table.Repository

# Build and Test
No tests since we only have interfaces and placeholder classes.
